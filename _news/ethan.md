My Ph.D. student [Ethan Che](https://ethche.github.io/) is on the faculty job market. He works on AI-driven approaches to large-scale operational decision-making. His thesis has taken strides in scalable auto-differentiation-based methods for [queueing network control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03740) and [adaptive experimentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04570).
