      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me.

I am an assistant professor in the [Decision, Risk, and Operations](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/decision-risk-operations) division at [Columbia Business School](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/) and a member of the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/). My research interests lie at the interface of machine learning and decision-making. I develop robust and reliable methods for data-driven decision making, extending and connecting tools across ML, operations research, and causal inference. Outside of academia, I serve as a LinkedIn Scholar at LinkedIn's Trust and Responsible AI team.

I received my Ph.D. from [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu) in 2019 and spent a year at [Facebook Core Data Science](https://research.fb.com/core-data-science/) as a research scientist. Here's a more formal [bio](./bio.html) in the third person.

I go by Hong; alternatively, here's a [link](https://forvo.com/word/%ED%99%8D%EC%84%9D/#ko) for the correct pronunciation of my first name. My pronouns are he/him/his.
