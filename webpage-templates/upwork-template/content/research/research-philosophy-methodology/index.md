The standard algorithmic development paradigm for decision-making relies on theoretical performance guarantees and as a result, often ignore important operational constraints or are non-performant in practice. While theoretical insights can provide invaluable principles, their successful operationalization requires recognizing and internalizing the limitations of crude approximations and unverifiable assumptions we put in place for mathematical convenience. 

We identify central intellectual bottlenecks in real-world problems, and resolve them by building computational and data-centric foundations borne out of mathematical principles. Our research methodology aims to connect two disparate yet complementary worldviews:

- rigorous empirical benchmarking practices arising from the AI research community’s data-centric approach
- theoretical and computational tools from statistical learning, optimization, applied probability, and casual inference.

I take inspiration from Von Neumann’s perspective on mathematical sciences, which I paraphrase below.

> As a mathematical discipline travels far from its empirical source only indirectly inspired from ideas coming from 'reality', it is beset with grave dangers that it will develop along the line of least resistance and become more and more purely aestheticizing. This need not be bad if the discipline is under the influence of researchers with an exceptionally well-developed taste, but the only general remedy is the rejuvenating return to the source: the reinjection of directly empirical ideas. I am convinced that this is a necessary condition to conserve the freshness and the vitality of the subject, and that this will remain so in the future.

I am extremely fortunate to be able to learn from the well-developed taste of my fabulous colleagues at Columbia and beyond. Concurrent to this ongoing personal education, I (try to) inject empirical ideas to formulate research directions to increase the impact of my research.
