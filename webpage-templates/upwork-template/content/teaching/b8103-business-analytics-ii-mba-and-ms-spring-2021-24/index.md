Business analytics refers to the ways in which enterprises such as businesses, non-profits, and governments use data to gain insights and make better decisions. This course develops a critical understanding of modern analytics methodology, studying its foundations, potential applications, and—perhaps most importantly—limitations. For MBA students, this is a continuation of Business Analytics where you will apply these methods to new cases in a broad range of industries.

*   You will learn how to use these methods in more unstructured and diverse situations, on complex real-life datasets, and on a broader range of structured and unstructured data (such as text data).
*   We will cover substantially more complex yet flexible methodologies for predictive analytics than those you saw in Business Analytics. For example, you will learn about random forests, which is one of the most powerful analytics method to date.
*   The course introduces a framework that will help you translate business needs and priorities into analytic problems.
*   You will learn the language required to communicate with data scientists and other engineers implementing these models.
*   We will develop a holistic and critical perspective to analytics and AI systems. You will learn how to recognize and communicate the inherent limitations of a predictive model, and how to design more reliable analytics systems.
