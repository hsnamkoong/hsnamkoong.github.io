I am an assistant professor in the [Decision, Risk, and Operations](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/decision-risk-operations) division at [Columbia Business School](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu) and a member of the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu). My research interests lie at the interface of machine learning and decision-making. I develop robust and reliable methods for data-driven decision making, extending and connecting tools across ML, operations research, and causal inference. Outside of academia, I serve as a LinkedIn Scholar at LinkedIn's Trust and Responsible AI team.

I received my Ph.D. from [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu) and spent a year at Meta's Adaptive Experimentation team as a research scientist. Here's a more
formal [bio](/bio) in the third person. 

I go by Hong; alternatively, here's a [link](https://forvo.com/word/%ED%99%8D%EC%84%9D/#ko) the correct pronunciation of my first name.
