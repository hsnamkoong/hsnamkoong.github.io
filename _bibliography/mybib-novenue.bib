Abstract={Different distribution shifts require different interventions, and algorithms must be grounded in the specific shifts they address. Advocating for an inductive approach to research on distributional robustness, we build an empirical testbed, "WhyShift", comprising of natural shifts across 5 tabular datasets and 60,000 model configurations encompassing imbalanced learning algorithms and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) methods. We find Y|X-shifts are most prevalent on our testbed, in stark contrast to the heavy focus on X (covariate)-shifts in the ML literature. We conduct
an in-depth empirical analysis of DRO methods and find that the underlying model class (e.g.,
neural networks, XGBoost) and hyperparameter selection have a first-order impact in practice
despite being overlooked by DRO researchers. To further bridge that gap between methodological
research and practice, we design case studies that illustrate how such a refined understanding of
distribution shifts can enhance both data-centric and algorithmic interventions.},

abstract={Starting with my one-year stint at Meta's adaptive
                  experimentation team, I've been pondering on how
                  bandit algorithms are largely designed by
                  theoreticians to achieve good regret bounds and are
                  rarely used in practice due to the difficulty of
                  implementation and poor empirical performance. In
                  this work, we focus on underpowered, short-horizon,
                  and large-batch problems that typically arise in
                  practice. We use large batch normal approximations
                  to derive an MDP formulation for deriving the
                  optimal adaptive design. Our formulation allows the
                  use of computational tools for designing adaptive
                  algorithms, a break from the existing theory-driven
                  paradigm.
                  Our approach significantly improves statistical power over standard 
                  methods, even when compared to Bayesian bandit algorithms 
                  (e.g., Thompson sampling) that require full distributional knowledge 
                  of individual rewards. Overall, we expand the scope of 
                  adaptive experimentation to settings that are difficult 
                  for standard methods, involving limited adaptivity, 
                  low signal-to-noise ratio, and unknown reward distributions.},
